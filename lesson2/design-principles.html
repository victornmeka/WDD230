                    <p>
                        In design principles, alignment refers to the way the different elements in a design are
                        organised or arranged in relation to each other or to part of the pages like the borders or
                        edges.
                        The elements can be centered, right-aligned or left-aligned relative to other items in the
                        design.
                        <br>In this example of a mobile facebook login webpage, we see several items aligned centrally
                        to the webpage, the heading and logo(facebook), the
                        the login button, the forotten password link and also the create account button. There are also
                        enough white space between
                        each elements.

                        Piggyvest Saving Platform

                        Constrast is the use of visible difference to attract attention. It basically determines the
                        first thing you want a viewer to look at.
                        It is designing a distinct difference between the foreground and background colors in order to
                        enhance readability and user interaction.
                        <br>In this example, we see the black "create free account" button having a background
                        quite
                        different from the webpage white background color. The constrast exists to persuade users to
                        click on them so they begin interacting with the page immediately.

                    <p>
                        Visual Hierachy is the principle of systematically arranging webpage elements according to the
                        order of their importance.<br>
                        Visual Hierachy is used to rank elements in the order you want your users to view them.<br>
                        In this example, we first see the brand logo followed by the link to explore their
                        products(phones).<br>
                        We also see a bold hero image advertising their latest products containing the "Reserve now"
                        link to explore
                        their newest product and then the image of the product all systematically arranged.
